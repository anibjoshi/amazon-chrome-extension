The package came with a VERY small bottle of scent that you have to sprinkle onto the dried items in order to get a scent. The quality of the Rose scent is actually quite nice, with no odd chemical odors. That is a great positive for this potpourri. However, that nice and light scent doesn't last very long. I made two small bowls and used about half of the VERY small bottle of scent between the two bowls. The scent lasted a bit over a week, and that was it. Once the scent evaporates there is nearly no scent left. Back a couple of decades ago when potpourri seemed much more popular I could buy big bags locally. And their scent would last months, and the scent was infused into the dried flowers and other dried items with no need to sprinkle a scent oil on. I've had some potpourri that is pre-infused that I could still smell nearly a YEAR later. This product not at all. I expect a potpourri to have a nice scent that lasts at least 2-3 months with a nice intensity of scent. That does not happen with this potpourri, not at all. I will not be purchasing this potpourri again as it is too expensive for a scent that only last about 2 weeks.</td>\n",

              "1  I got the blue ones, 2 pack. They're beautiful and smells great but the scent lasted maybe 2 weeks. I kept them and plan to put essential oils on them and see how that does. I love the look just wish it held the scent longer.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       \n",
              "2  I bought the \"Rose\" scented package. There were a decent amount of dried flowers and other ingredients. The package came with a VERY small bottle of scent that you have to sprinkle onto the dried items in order to get a scent. The quality of the Rose scent is actually quite nice, with no odd chemical odors. That is a great positive for this potpourri. However, that nice and light scent doesn't last very long. I made two small bowls and used about half of the VERY small bottle of scent between the two bowls. The scent lasted a bit over a week, and that was it. Once the scent evaporates there is nearly no scent left. Back a couple of decades ago when potpourri seemed much more popular I could buy big bags locally. And their scent would last months, and the scent was infused into the dried flowers and other dried items with no need to sprinkle a scent oil on. I've had some potpourri that is pre-infused that I could still smell nearly a YEAR later. This product not at all. I expect a potpourri to have a nice scent that lasts at least 2-3 months with a nice intensity of scent. That does not happen with this potpourri, not at all. I will not be purchasing this potpourri again as it is too expensive for a scent that only last about 2 weeks.   \n",

              "4  I am usually an \"anti-scent\" person as most scents give me a headache. But, my mom really likes having things like this in her room for a \"pop of color\" as she puts it. I didn't realize when I ordered, but was pleased to find that there actually isn't a scent on it at first. It comes with a tiny bottle of oil (I think it's oil - some kind of liquid) that is the scent, so you can put on as little or as much as you want! Yay! Mom can have her pop of color and I can have my scent free home, win-win. Also, it's very pretty! Take a minute or two to pick out your favorite pieces and put them on top so you can enjoy them the most.

              "'  it suited and worked out well with my bathroom setting!!!!. bought   of these to fill a vase/jar in my bathroom. color did go well with my bathroom setting. scent smell is good enough and keeping the bad odor out of my bathroom. it worked out for me.  used  .  packs to fill the jar (  inches height ,  .  inches diameter)  they\\'re pretty but wishes they held the scent longer. i got the blue ones,   pack. they\\'re beautiful and smells great but the scent lasted maybe   weeks. i kept them and plan to put essential oils on them and see how that does. i love the look just wish it held the scent longer.  alluring. a product looks appealing with an alluring aroma. a man found a small empty bottle of scented oil in a package, he is not sure why. a man also discovers potpourri means “rotten pot” in french.  very nice. i am usually an \"anti-scent\" person as most scents give me a headache. but, my mom really likes having things like this in her room for a \"pop of color\" as she puts it. i didn\\'t realize when i ordered, but was pleased to find that there actually isn\\'t a scent on it at first. it comes with a tiny bottle of oil (i think it is oil - some kind of liquid) that is the scent, so you can put on as little or as much as you want! yay! mom can have her pop of color and i can have my scent free home, win-win. also, it is very pretty! take a minute or two to pick out your favorite pieces and put them on top so you can enjoy them the most. good find!  potpourri bag yellow color scented. potpourri was small & cute for what i needed it for to fill a dish in my bathroom which didn\\'t have bulky big items in it and that is what i wanted, it also came with a very small bottle of fragrance, which didn\\'t last long-but all in all it covered what i needed it for  smells wonderful. this smells wonderful. but i need more of the oil that\\'s included. how do i buy the exact oil separately? other than that would have given a perfect rating  it is very pretty with the different pieces. in a pretty dish, just the right accent piece.. i thought the colors and the different pieces were very nice. i was sure it came with a little scent bottle with dropper. i plan on getting the green and the tourquise. my husband of   years passed away and i have a table that i keep his picture on, a vase with flowers from the funeral and a little bowl that i keep dark chocolate hershey kisses in for when i want a kiss from him. i added the potpourri in a matching bowl and added to the table ( i did not add all in the one bag, i am going to put the rest in my room). it looks very pretty. i can’t address the longevity of the aroma since i just received it today. i posted a pic but the pic does not do the colors justice. i did not use the second bag, i plan on putting in some cloth and putting in my dresser drawers. i love it.  perfect product. the turquoise color looks even better in person and the smell of this potpourri is amazing. i would and will buy this again.  it is nice if i didn\\'t know where else to look..... i ordered the april garden color and it is really nice. it has a delicate scent that does not overpower the room. the product is packed beautifully. it really adds some depth to my bathroom. it also comes with some more oil to freshen it up.  however, i went to my local dollar tree and they had the same single bag for a buck!!! (no oil included or fancy packaging) i swear it is the same. so.... you guys can guess where i\\'ll be buying from next.  the fragrance. i love the fragrance so much. i had an old water fountain that no longer worked, so i used it as a vase for the potpourri from qingbei rina. also, the inclusion of the little bottle of the liquid fragrance was an added bonus. definitely will order over and over and over again. price point was very fair given that you received a bottle of the liquid fragrance.  i love it! thank you,  sandia  love this!. very happy with this purchase. fits with our overall color scheme (blue/white) and i really like the scent. includes a small vial of the essential oil when the scent fades over time which is appreciated! i do have to find a nicer bowl to display it in now!  almost   stars!. received this today and the scent dropper was nearly empty when arrived. [picture attached] other than that, delivery was fast, colors were as expected, and scent was not overwhelming. placed in a cylinder in my kid\\'s bathroom.  beautiful for fall decorating. love the color and subtle citrus aroma. i was impressed that a small vial of oil was included for refreshing the potpourri as needed. the aroma is not strong, but i also use scented candles, so i am not dependent on the potpourri for a pleasant smell. i would order this again just for the color and beauty of the mixture.  nice. good price for   bags. was able to fill each vase completely.  bigger bottles of scent oil are differently needed , since the scent only last a many an hour.. beautiful scent, my daughter loved the rose scent , only if the scent lasted longer, a tiny bottle was included , many if that six drops i got out of that tiny bottle for two nice size bags of potpourri not enough scent oil. or let the buyer know where to order additional bottles . other than that my bathroom smells beautiful.  toxic to pets. smells very nice! it was a bit too pungent at first and thought it’d bother my daughter who’s allergic to fragrances but after   hrs it is just perfect! i also read it is toxic to cats and although i have three they’re very well fed and have plenty of toys they weren’t curious to eat or play w/chips! so be careful if you have pers!  blue ocean potpourri. the fragrance was very nice. color, scent, packaging and very fast it came in. i ordered this for my daughters wedding. very nice from this company.  price could be lower. great color. there was no free gift attached and there was no link to select the free gift. fresh scent  the fragrance. i love the fragrance so much. i had an old water fountain that no longer worked, so i used it as a vase for the potpourri from qingbei rina. also, the inclusion of the little bottle of the liquid fragrance was an added bonus. definitely will order over and over and over again. price point was very fair given that you received a bottle of the liquid fragrance.  i love it! thank you,  sandia  love this!. very happy with this purchase. fits with our overall color scheme (blue/white) and i really like the scent. includes a small vial of the essential oil when the scent fades over time which is appreciated! i do have to find a nicer bowl to display it in now!  almost   stars!. received this today and the scent dropper was nearly empty when arrived.

the bathroom smells like the ocean! love it.  definitely would recommend!. i gave it   stars only because i can’t really smell it that good once it is in the dish. the smell is really beautiful, and looks very pretty in the dish. just wish it was a stronger smell!  amazing...... my daughter was trying plug ins and i said no no - mom got you and she loves it , now she orders it on her own for her new house ...thank you  pleasant smell. the color is a soft yellow with shades of black/brown throughout. the scent is pleasant mixture of soft flowers/powder/lemons but not over powered. only used for   days now still has pleasant smell.   bags were sealed well, tied with ribbon, no tears. i would buy this product again.  lovely scent but does not last long.. beautiful pot pourri with bright colors and smells very nice. unfortunately the scent does not last very long.  grateful!

 scent. gift  great color, small amount, oil leaked, good smell but not lasting. i purchased these for the color (orange) alone. the color is oranger and brighter than burnt oranges and browns as show in the photos. i read that some thought there would be more filler, so i bought a two pack and am glad i did. i referenced the package size by standing it next to a beer bottle and the width of the package is about the same size, unlike usual potpourri with the larger pieces. the potpourri smelled like oranges when it arrived, very nice, but noticed it didn\\'t smell much after a week. i placed my bowl on a shelf on march   and took it down today, march  , to take more photos. i had not opened the scented oil bottle (it was included) and left it on top of the potpourri, only to find it had leaked. i am not sure why it leaked now and hadn\\'t during transit. as someone noted, the bottle was only half filled, but in my experience with very small bottles, i don\\'t expect it to be filled to the brim. i don\\'t even think the basic description indicated it included the oil, so it would have been a bonus. overall, i am happy with the purchase because i really just wanted it for the color.  wonderful. i bought this potpourri to use to stuff ornaments i made. the scent was wonderful and the pieces were the right size for what i needed. they even supplied a small bottle of rose oil which was great. i highly recommend this product and will most likely get more myself.  very pretty and smells nice!. i would say that the quantity of potpourri that you get for the price is pretty good. for some reason, potpourri tends to be expensive, and getting enough of it to fill things up can sometimes be pricey. these two bags are pretty sizeable and i was able to fill a very big, shallow basket about half full with the two of them. i also got another box of potpourri from the same company to provide a little more \"substance\" since the pieces in it are bigger. but overall i am very happy with the look, smell, and color of this potpourri.  beautiful and a lot of care and time must have gone into creating these beautiful potpourri packages.  st of all these came in a very timely fashion. they came in such a cute package. a lot of care went into making these and packaging. i love everything about them the color the smell, they were just perfect. definitely would buy again!!!!

love it at the first sight ! it is packaged in   bags. i used one of them in the entryway yesterday, now the whole space is full of a cool delicate aroma! will put another in my bathroom. great value! recommend!  such a longlasting scent. this is the longest lasting potpourri i have ever purchased. months ago placed in small bowl in bathroom, where door is mostly open, and when you walk in. . . the aroma is still present. this is my second purchase of this scent, and will be back for more. this is a quality product, exceptional and, oh, lovely presentation.  looks pretty. the scent was very faint and what i did smell wasn\\'t as good as i had hoped. i most likely will not purchase again.  high quality appearance & ample scent. very pleased with this potpourri! strongly scented from bag. i expect it to last a long time. came with a small vial of refresher oil! the bits and pieces of natural objects are interesting and visually pleasing in the bowl.  not your grandmother\\'s potpourri. this potpourri smells delightful and fresh. i love the look of it. i also am happy that it came with a vial of scented oil to refresh once the smell fades. i will say you only need a little bit out at a time. i made the mistake of dumping the entire bag out in an uncovered bowl and the scent was very overpowering.  very good, smells nice. very cute and just want i needed for my bathroom. ive had it in a mason jar for a few weeks now and the scent is still just as strong as the day i put it in there. its a nice clean scent and im usually very sensitive to smells.  love the scent. this is part of a christmas gift that i purchased for my daughter. when i opened the shipping package, i immediately smelled the fresh scent of oranges. it wasn\\'t too overbearing, just a pleasant aroma. i hope the scent last until she receives and opens the package.  beautiful and great value for price!. the scent and the vibrant color are amazing!
