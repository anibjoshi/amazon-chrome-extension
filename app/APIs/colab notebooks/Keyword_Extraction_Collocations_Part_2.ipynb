gaming pc (i5 6500 and rx 470 in a 600 watts power supply) and an apple tv switching sometimes for a nintendo switch. this thing is awesome. the only thing that you can see is the grey cable piece and the beautiful squared angled plug in the wall. looks so well done and does not get in the way making the setup look ugly or something. looks well build, done and designed. will definitely buy more of this same one when needed. this cord gives plenty of room and the wire feels both strong and flexible. i didnt realize that the cord comes out to the right of the switch, which isnt a big deal, since you have a lot of room with the cord, but it is something to take not of if you will need all 8 feet for your purposes. also, it only has 3 outlets, which is fine, but if you are plugging in a bulky laptop cord, you have more like 2 outlets, unless your other 2 plugs are very small. it\\'s funny how a little thing like a cloth wrap on the cord can make a product seem so much nicer and higher end. it does slide over itself and across shelf corners where a rubber/plastic cord would get stuck or tangled, so it\\'s practical too. really, the flat, angled plug on this this is half of what makes it so excellent. i use it behind my turntable/record shelf, and it would probably not fit if it were a standard straight plug.  i do really wish that this thing had a master on/off switch like bigger power bars do, but that\\'s a pretty minor gripe. all in all, really nice product. an extension cord with surge protection, what a terrific idea! no longer do you need to buy a huge surge protector, you can just get this and it gives you three convenient outlets.  the low-profile prong is great when you want this plugged flat against the wall, and the braided cord is good at keeping this tangle-free.  i think my only question is: how do we know this cord has done its job of protecting your devices from a surge? does it stop working? it would be great if the manufacturer could clarify.  i got two of these and they are very handy around the house. recommended. these cords are a must have, i don\\'t have anything bad to say about them after having used them for at least a year now. i recently bought a second one for the bedroom.  what i like: -well braided - no cheap feel. -firm plug-in, not too hard to plug in or remove power cords -the flat plug helps greatly if behind furniture.  i use two of these by my bed and one goes to each side so that me and my girlfriend can plug in our phones, smart watches, tablets, etc. i leave the brick nearby and can pull it further onto the bed for those times you lay in bed all day and play on your tablet or laptop and need power.  there are no con\\'s to this item, i\\'ve had no issues for the year or so i\\'ve owned it and honestly that\\'s how it should be with something as simple as an extension cord. very disappointed. i plugged it in right after i got it out of the packaging and it did not work. i tried many different outlets and nothing seemed to get this cord to work. the surge protector itself is good and i always appreciate angled wall plugs, but the braided cable is insanely heavy compared to the unit itself so it can\\'t really sit on top of a table or desk without being pulled down by the weight of the cable. still a good buy if you\\'re okay with leaving it on the floor. truly a beautiful looking extension cord, that looks about as classy as one of these can look. the braided cable is handsome, strong, and flexible. the flat plug is totally convenient and doesn\\'t get in the way of other plugs. i have the version without usb, but i kind of wish i had gotten the usb version i was positively impressed with the quality of this 8-foot cord, but know the surge protection is so minimal that it is of questionable value. i am unsure why the included paper says to disconnect when not in use, so i hope that isnt because of surge protection failure.  the length is long, sometimes causing the cord to lay on the floor in a loop, but that really demonstrates the difference between this braided cord and the less expensive ones. having all your sockets on one side is nice until you want to insert a big wall wart ac-dc adapter, at which point you ruin the astetic by adding an unattractive shortie that moves the adapter away from the cord.  i purchased four (4) of these to try a premium cord in bedrooms i was re-doing and they really are impressively different, but they wont become my go-to cord and remain a bit of a novelty for me. ive plugged this into 3 different outlets and it ruined each of them. actual flames have come out and burned the outlets. buy a different extension cord so you dont burn down your house like i almost did now now now these are some awesome

and burned the outlets. buy a different extension cord so you dont burn down your house like i almost did i\\'ve bought three of these because they\\'re great to put behind furniture.  the flat plug takes up half the room as a normal plug. the cord itself is really flexible and allows for all different types of movement. it can be easily wrapped around something or snaked up or down a wall. best of all, the outlets themselves are surge protected.  this type of braided extension cord gives you piece of mind and allows for ultimately flexibility for around your home. they look good as well! the white blends in nicely and doesn\\'t give the ugly appearance look of a cord. we have one that comes from behind a wall mounted tv, and it\\'s not obtrusive at all.  eight feet of cord is a pretty good size but i do wish they had a 6 outlet with the same length as well.  we are very happy with this purchase and have no complaints for the product itself. good job, ge! this is about the nicest extension cord i\\'ve ever owned (or even seen!). the plug is molded without manufacturing iines, and the cloth covering on the cord insulation gives it an upscale appearance. this cord would be at home in any room without adding any tackiness factor. my only minor issue, which i have with all 45plugs, is that, if the grounding hole on the receptacle is above the electric current slots (which is a more secure and safe way to install a receptacle), the cord angles upward to the right, rather than downward to the left (which the designers no doubt had in mind). so, if the plug is exposed, you\\'ll have to decide if it\\'s worth it to flip the receptacle in the wall to make the end result \"prettier\". my son bought me this because i needed to plug in more things. i really wanted a 6-outlet extension. it works fine and the wrapped cord will probably last a long time. i have no complaints about it.  i prefer a longer-corded surge protector type items with room to plug in six items, so it\\'s not fair to judge this based on that.  because it is as described and works well, i gave it 5 stars. my son bought this because it was cheaper than the longer ones that accepted more plugs. i think if you need this length and need to plug in two more things, it will be perfect for you. we first plugged a phone charger directly into the wall outlet, which worked fine, and second, through this extension cord, which did not work 90% of the time, and 10% of the time did work but was intermittent. this is a faulty unit. the cord is also very thick, stiff and hard to work with. i recently plugged this in after it sat for a while. flames shot out. this product look great! i loved the braided cord and sturdiness of this item. however after only 2.5 years when i plug it in it smells like smoke. i can see a little bit of a burn mark around one of the outlets where i had one item plugged in. scary! i bought this one a long time ago and forgot to review, but recently we had a thunderstorm come through, and i had both my phone and my ipad charging on this extender. our power went out, but my devices didnt dry. im grateful to this cord for protecting my precious gadgets. i like this cord because it has the full outlets at the end where i can plug in my laptop. the plug-in part comes off of the outlet to the side a bit and that is nice for plugging things in underneath it. it has a good length too/reaches easily the width of my bed. i\\'m sure i could travel with it but it is kind of thick so i don\\'t due to its size/weight. i had kept this cord on the side and when i wanted to use this earlier this week it blows a fuse every time. in other words it is a defect and would like to return it. came defective,one outlet has no power, i\\'ve bought three of these

it. came defective,one outlet has no power, i chose this extension cord over other options because: 1) it provides some surge protection (250 joules is not much protection, but most extension cords offer none). 2) flat plug. 3) i justified the price because of #1 & #2.  while i assume it uses mov (metal oxide varistor) surge protection, i wish your product description validated this. i wanted to add a power strip to my desk, but my desk is nearly flush against the wall. i was on the hunt for something that would fit in the narrow space between wall & desk and look good against my white desk. i found this surge protector/extension cord with a flat plug and woven cord. it fit all my requirements - fit between wall & desk, looks stylish in my office, and with some simple command strips (poster strips), i was able to secure it to the inside of my desk leg so it doesn\\'t move around. the cord is mostly hidden and keeps everything need and tidy. i was very pleased with the weight and style of this surge protector, it doesn\\'t look like typical industrial office equipment and was very cost-effective. i bought a couple of these, for places where i need to extend the wall socket (duh) and though they\\'re mostly hidden, they\\'d be somewhat visual; white is much better than brown for me (and way better than orange for this use!), and i couldn\\'t be more pleased. they\\'re super high quality and look so good that i don\\'t mind at all that you can see them.  they are a little stiff and so if you have a very tight turn right next to the outlet they might not be for you. not incredibly stiff, they bend fine, but the quality of the cloth wrapping does make them less flexible than a purely plastic cord. i love this extension cord! i pet sit and often stay over at peoples houses to do so. i keep this in my overnight bag! then i dont have to struggle to get my phone plugged in when the night stand plug in is inconvenient behind the bed, already filled up with lamp cords, etc. no problem! i just use another plug in! with my extension cord handy i can still charge and use my phone on the sofa, in bed, etc! love the clean design on this extension cord! looks very modern and nice in our house, i love that i don\\'t have to fuss with a tangled plastic cord and it actually looks nice where the cord is exposed. i also like how the cord comes out of the side of the plug, so that you can easily plug it in behind furniture without kinking the cord or pulling your furniture out awkwardly. i plan to buy more of these. this cord is nice due to the surge protection feature. i am using it to protect my tv along with running the cord up a wall utilizing cable management. this works well for that purpose.  in addition, it just fits well enough behing a flush mounted tv in order for me to totally hide all the wires. coming from cheap and crappy dollar store extension cords, this is really a world of difference, and it\\'s no longer something i\\'d be ashamed to leave hanging around. the cord is nice and thick and won\\'t tangle, while being flexible enough to lay nicely flat on the ground on any position. it\\'s a no brainer and have bought a few of these already to have around the house. my gf subsconsciously lays on the side of the bed that has the wall outlets next to them. she hogs both plugs and i don\\'t want to reach over her all the time. got this little thing and plugged it into the surge protector on the wall by the foot of the bed. problem solved lol now i have 3 \"3 prongers\" while she\\'s got her 2 \"2s\". all kidding aside the product is exactly what i wanted. got laptop and phone plugged in. i\\'ve had this for a couple months now and have no complaints. i needed an extension cord to run from the top of my bookshelf to behind my wall-mounted tv as we got rid of our entertainment center to make more room in the living room for our great danes to run around. i was looking for 3 specifics: 1) at least a 6\\' cord, preferred longer but not more than 10\\' 2) flexible and attractive cord 3) at lease 3 plug-ins in a row stacked vertically so i could utilize my smart plug.  this thing met all my requirements and i couldn\\'t be happier. i love these cords. only one thing could make them better...a swiveling plug. if you have to go to the left, then you lose a few inches in the cord, and you have a loop. belkin makes a cord with a swiveling plug, but i don\\'t like the plain vinyl cord. the ge cord is a cloth braided cord that is very flexible. this item came to my home well packaged and on time. this extension cord is a nice change of pace to the plain white, black or brown extension cords from the stores. good length, easy to use. thanks! i was looking for a surge protector just for my laptop to plug into. i was only wanting a few ports on the surge protector. i only got it today, but it looks great and seems to be working great. the cable is long, i was only expecting a 3 ft cable for some reason, maybe i read it wrong. but the cable seems long. great item for the cost. mine is the one without the usb ports. with so much money invested in my electronics ... this is an inexpensive solution to the risk of unexpected power surges ...  the product seems to be of substantial quality for a reasonable price ... hopefully i won\\'t have to experience a power surge to test that fact ... works great! this is the second one ive purchased because it works so well. the first one ive got is 2 years old and still works, i just needed another one because i have so many cords. i use this for my apple watch charger, mac book charger and phone charger. if you need more plugs i definitely recommend this one. great extension cord! very flexible so it can wrap around objects easily. the flat plug is great and tucks into the wall perfectly. i bought three of them and will gladly purchase again if needed. highly recommend. two out of the three plugs do not work!!!! don\\'t buy it. i was shopping for a heavy duty extension cord that had some sort of protection but nothing extreme. this fit the bill at a good price so i ordered it. it came as promised and it\\'s working great. will buy it again if i need another. this cord is a game changer. the flat plug is great and the cord is nice and heavy so i never worry about it. we\\'ve used it for about 3 months with no issues. note the plug angles to the right side, which was perfect for our specific needs but may not suit specific settings. this thing is pretty slick. we needed an extension cord to go behind a piece of furniture and have it pop out where its visible in our living room. this cord looks and feels very nice. it reminds me of usb cables that are braided... just a general premium feel. i also like how its only 3 outlets - small form factor is perfect for our use case. perfect for my room because now i can plug things into my wall without my bed destroying the cord. it saves me lots of space too. perfect length and lasted me a very long time. no complaints. i think from on now ill always buy these type of cords for any situations this item came to my home well packaged and on time. this

it has a nice angular plug, so it sneaks behind our chest quickly. three outlets all work. cord was as long as advertised. i\\'m liking the braided wires more than regular plastic... looks classier.  if you want something to turn your one plug into three, this will do the trick. i ordered this cord to replace an old one that my charger kept falling out of. though i enjoy most of the construction of the cord, i can see that i will have the same problem with my chargers very quickly because they already have a loose fit. this is great except it only had 3 three plugs. if you go to hotels you will notice that they do not have near enough outlets for ask the things we have to plug in at night. i thought this was the answer but sadly it wasn\\'t. got this to replace the fire hazard that has presumably been passed down for 3 generations in my wife\\'s family. this extension is nice to look at, doesn\\'t get tangled and feels very durable. we have cats that sometimes like to get in fights with cables and this one seems pretty immune to that kind of abuse. probably the best extension cord ever! i hate my other extension cords because how awesome this one is. the cord i almost moldable and the flat part for wall outlet just makes sense. the price is very fair for what you get. going into college, i was looking for a suitable extension cord that was durable! one good thing about this cord is that it has a braided cable, so it doesn\\'t really like to curl, nor will it easily be broken. i have personally tripped over my cord a couple of times, and so far, there have been no issues. one thing to note is that it only has 3 plugs. i wish there would be a few more. but, other than that, it is a great cable! i thought this was a good deal (i guess it could be to some) but i was at home depot today and they sell this exact same thing for the exact same price only 10 feet instead of 8. *shrug* works perfect for plugging in a wall mounted tv. i have the plug end velcroed to the tv wall mount and the cord runs down the wall and along the wall and back up to the wall plug in. so glad i went with the 8 foot cord!! really like this extension cord! it looks and functions much better than the old, cheap cords. the braided cord is cool, and the small surge protector plug is awesome. i like it so much, i am ordering a second one. i needed an extension cord for my television and dvd player in my bedroom. it needed to have a long cord and multiple outlets. it has not disappointed and it lays flat along the wall so it is not in the way. no problems with the product at all to date.

flat along the wall so it is not in the way. no problems with the product at all to date. it\\'s an extension cord, and while there\\'s nothing wild about that this was a great product. i love the angled plug to squeeze it behind objects, the textured cord helps it blend in, and the power flows like it should. overall, i\\'ll look to these for all my indoor extension cord needs. the three outlets are too close together to plug more than 2 apple power adapters in... most extension cords are 2 outlets on one side and a 3rd on the other... the design of this cord makes it less useful. i was bummed to see i\\'d need to buy a whole new $15 bit set for my screwdriver just to get one special \"y\" bit in order to unscrew the plastic casing. i need to drill holes in it so i can mount it to the wall, but i obviously can\\'t do that while it\\'s screwed together. i respect electricity, and prefer all my cables/cords be extra-sturdy. this one definitely is well made, and i feel safe using it. can\\'t say much about the surge protection, but i don\\'t really care about that. this is the tesla of extension cables. i purchased this in order to make a nice extension to a bidet, the quality of this cable is extremely good, and looks great when properly affixed to a wall. having surge protection is a great additional feature of this, and is priced amazingly for what you get. the packaging was good quality and easy to open. i like the braided power cord that gives ease of moving around and no coiling. the plug even came with a special made protective plastic. it was just what i needed. the cord and cord covering look to be durable and stylish. i used this to plug in a tv that sits on a dresser, with the plug behind. the flush plug head is important in this application. i bought this cord to replace my old extension cord. its stylish for an extension cord. it sometimes stops charging my phone, though. ive even bought a new cord and cube from apple thinking it was my phone charger but it still randomly quits working. not really sure whats going on with that. nice high quality cords that don\\'t look ugly. the braided cloth(?) wires add a nice touch and dont look like the typical ugly plastic looking expension cord. killed two phone chargers in a week. something is definitely not right with this extension cord. it\\'s an extension cord, and while there\\'s nothing wild about that this was a great product. i love the angled plug to squeeze it behind objects, the textured cord helps it blend in, and the power flows like it should. overall, i\\'ll look to these for all my indoor extension cord needs. the three outlets are too close together to plug more than 2 apple power adapters in... most extension cords are 2 outlets on one side and a 3rd on the other... the design of this cord makes it less useful. i was bummed to see i\\'d need to buy a whole new $15 bit set for my screwdriver just to get one special \"y\" bit in order to unscrew the plastic casing. i need to drill holes in it so i can mount it to the wall, but i obviously can\\'t do that while it\\'s screwed together. i respect electricity, and prefer all my cables/cords be extra-sturdy. this one definitely is well made, and i feel safe using it. can\\'t say much about the surge protection, but i don\\'t really care about that. this is the tesla of extension cables. i purchased this in order to make a nice extension to a bidet, the quality of this cable is extremely good, and looks great when properly affixed to a wall. having surge protection is a great additional feature of this, and is priced amazingly for what you get. the packaging was good quality and easy to open. i like the braided power cord that gives ease of moving around and no coiling. the plug even

extension cord. wanted my printer in a location, but it\\'s cable wouldn\\'t reach the outlet, this fixed the problem. powers a mini fridge, microwave on 80% and a large coffee maker. its passed the test for about 6 months now. pretty, cord is flexible but not a surge protector....purchased for that purpose.... not worth your money or having your house catch on fire. i had this plugged into an outlet in my bedroom for about a week until it caught fire and exploded. do not buy. this product is exactly what i needed, it has 3 outlets and has a relatively slim side plug that goes into the wall.  the cord is braided very well and seems \"armored\" great extension cord if you want to plug in only 2 devices. a third one will not fit. i have 2 apple devices and one dexcom cgm receiver to be charged each night. all 3 will not fit will never use old kind of wire extension cords again after this...practical, doesn\\'t get twisted, heavy duty, and looks great on top of it. very nice. need to get more. i loved the flat plug aspect of this long cord as it was going behind a bed up against a wall. the length was the real draw. does not warm when in use. seemingly good material for price. i was so happy when i bought this, it has a great design and doesnt tangle and twist like other cords. but after using it for a month the middle plug doesnt work. ready to return it! haven\\'t had this very long yet, but the product build quality seems good. i like the braided cable as it looks nice and is flexible enough. little more boojie than your typical extension cable. wanted my printer

tv. due to the location of the outlet and where the ac adapter comes out from the tv, i needed this exact product for the power. i recommend this extension cord. ive been using this for the last few months. works perfectly for our needs. worth every penny. just remodeled my office and family room with gray pattern carpeting. some of my electrical outlets are exposed and i didnt want to see any of the heavy, stiff black cords. this cord is pliable and the color blends so well into the carpeting, that you cant even see it. this was just what i needed. eight feet version provides a lot of reach and the cord and outlet are of good quality. it\\'s good to know my things are protected from power surges with this. thanks! the lay flat plug head is so important. even if you aren\\'t trying to use an outlet behind a couch, this style is great for a seamless look on your wall. the cord looked really nice in person. bought quite a few! worked great, good insertion and firm hold on the plugs. nice flexible cord, well protected with the woven covering. is also nice and slick, so it doesn\\'t get tangled up in things, or itself, like a rubber cord. for the money i paid, i couldnt have asked for more. the cord length is good. it looks very sturdy and also looks of good quality. the right angled/ flat plug is really what i needed which this product has. the braided cord and general construction seems solid for the price. can\\'t say about longevity as it was a relatively new purchase but my first impressions are very positive. it is a quality item. i needed one with a flat, turned, plug end. fits my needs 100%. would buy again if i have need for another one. they sell similar extension cords that look exactly like this one at around the same price, but this one also has a built-in surge protector and states so right on the box. i don\\'t know if the other ones have surge protection or not, but why wouldn\\'t a brand mention that on the box if they did? buy this one, just to be on the safe side! i like that this plug offsets to the right side of the outlet. they look good and give an extra touch on boring extension cords- i got a couple of these and they have not let me down - i would yes buy again iconic american company shipped their products to china for production.  additional molding betwixt the cord and connectors reduces stress from normal use.  braided cloth cord won\\'t stink when exposed to petroleum distillates. it good extension for outlet behind the cabinet making it convenience access to plug any electronic devices with moving the cabinet and also you able to push back the cabinet all the way to the wall because of its 90 angle plug.  im recommending this product this actually my third one my first 2 was a shorter extension cord. thick and protected cable! perfect protection if you have cats trying to eat every cable in the house! also looks super chic and not at all tacky like most extension cords. it\\'s exactly as described. the cord is a kind of cloth wrapped around the plastic power cables? not sure what it\\'s made of but it\\'s very nice. as part of my move, i needed some affordable extension cords quickly. this came quickly and did the job well. the length was just what i needed, and it has the third prong (ground) as well. this was a reliable purchase that does what it\\'s supposed to do. very well made! so far it\\'s doing what it\\'s supposed to do! very happy i bought it for tree lights at christmas. definitely satisfied with this purchase. there\\'s only three ports on this so if you\\'re just looking to give your outlet some distance this is great. chord is very easy and flexible. power strip feel like all power strips, plastic. the design of this drop cord makes it possible to plug into the plug behind a cabinet and not make the cabinet stand out from the wall i like that this plug offsets to the right side of the outlet. they look good and give an extra touch on boring extension cords- i got a couple

makes it possible to plug into the plug behind a cabinet and not make the cabinet stand out from the wall i dont see the point of getting a 3-outlet extension cord if the outlets are so close to one another that you can only use 2 of them. sometimes i wonder who are the people designing those widely used products that are so unpractical. so nice to get rid of the long old surge protector extension cord to have something a little cleaner looking for simple electronics that don\\'t need a surge protector! we\\'re using it in the bathroom and have it secured underneath the vanity cabinets so there is power on the other side of the bathroom for charging razors, phones and electronic toothbrushes. needed an extension cord, saw this and purchased it. have an older house that doesn\\'t have a lot of outlets and this works perfectly. exactly what i needed to run power behind our bed for our nightstand lights. the way the outlet is to the side is a plus too. best value for my money for sure! i really like this product. in our master bedroom we only have 1 outlet on the headboard wall, right in the middle of the bed. so we bought two of these and have one going to each nightstand for a lamp and charging cables. works great.  really like the thick power cable and the fact that it\\'s nice and flush to the outlet when plugged in. really good design the only reason i have this 4 stars is because the cord comes out of the bottom angled to the right which makes it very awkward to use if you need the cord to go to the left. really needed for the flat plug, unfortunately could use one that the direction of the cord went the opposite direction but will do. works perfect. great for places like behind the couch, where you have power but cant reach. braided cord is nice and thick so its extremely durable. the plug is great, the cord is braided no-tangle, tough, good guage, medium long, the outlets are also great. built in surge suppression. no complain. highly recommend. a good sturdy cord that doesnt twist. really works as described and the cord wont twist. i like that its by a trusted brand like ge. this works great for our older home that has oddly placed outlets. with three prongs we can use it for more than just charging devices. my kids have told me we need another one. i really prefer the look of this cord to the old extension cords & will happily buy at least one more. this extension cord was better than i anticipated. i really needed a good reliable extension because the one i had, you barely touched and it would turn all of my gadgets off. this works great. i totally recommend it. stopped working after a small drop attractive thick cloth cord in white and grey colors. strong long cord with surge protection of 250 joules. won\\'t tangle. for the most part, this ext cord is as expected. seems like good quality for a ge label product. may purchase another? this is an attractive product that works well. it does its job, is quite long and has been the middleman between two surge protectors at opposite ends of the room.  my only comment would be to be careful with the actual chord. as it is not plastic, but cloth-like and gets dirty quickly. it went from being pristine white to gray over the course of a few weeks due to dirt, dust from outside, shoes and cats. husband said what did you get that for? a month later he needed an extension cord, guess what i used. its very nice heavy duty sturdy. i actually purchased to take when we travel. this is a very nice extension cord. the plug sits flat off the outlet rather than sticking out. the cord is nicely wrapped in a fabric with a premium feel. very happy with this product! i love that my cats aren\\'t able to even try chewing this cord up! the flat plug is perfect to fit behind my bed frame, and the cord is plenty long to run to my bedside table. three plugs are just enough for my humidifier, phone charger, and 1 to spare. the only downside is the outlets are pretty close together, so you have to be a little choosy when you have larger things to plug in. beautiful braided power cable! perfect for a wall mounted tv. i didn\\'t even have to run it through a channel since the braid is very high quality. i tested each port and they\\'re wired correctly. i live in a dorm, so my room is basically a nest of cords to power all the stuff in my room. i bought this one to plug into an outlet on the wall my bed is against to go underneath the bed to charge my phone. the flat/angled plug is great for this because it doesn\\'t protrude from the wall into where i sleep. works great, good length, and i ended up buying it again to use for my fridge. its exactly what i needed!!! it has the holes that accommodate plugs with the two different sized sides. its perfect! quality construction. the product was accurately advertised. reasonable price. arrived undamaged. recommend. got a second one a while ago after rearranging our place.  great buy and saw target & home depot are carrying them now too. this is a good extension for a desk setup where you want easier access to an outlet. could use an on/off switch. in the ever expanding list of expenses one incurs after having kids is baby-proofing. once we anchored our furniture to the walls, our extension cord that provides power to all the other baby crap on the room no longer fit behind the changing table. this plug had a low enough profile to fit between the changing table and the wall - a very tight fit, though i havent measured it to provide exact sizing. works great. it is really great to put under power outlets with furniture covering it without worrying if the wires are going to bend. it worked good for the first week or so but then we noticed it was super loose. anything you plugged in came right out with a smallest movement. it was super annoying and i woke up many mornings to my phone being dead cause i had come unplugged. great and pretty cheap. nice long cord. plug is angled off to the right. nice braided cord. much nicer construction than i was anticipating. allows multiple plug ins and surge protection. our power goes off occasionally and this has been a big help i live in a dorm, so my room is basically a nest of cords to power all the stuff in my room. i bought this one to plug into an outlet on the wall my bed is against to go underneath the

room and this has a flatter plug that i can push furniture against. great little cord. very glad it is flat against the wall outlet. i wish it has a couple usb slots, but i knew it didn\\'t when i bought it. not too obtrusive sitting on the corner of my desk. i like that the cord is braided, looks nicer than typical cord. the center socket won\\'t hold a plug. luckily i only needed 2 sockets or i would have returned the unit. solid very well-made extension cord. the plug faces the wrong direction but it still usable. it just takes some getting used to. it works as intended! if youre looking for an extension cord that isnt as unappealing to look at, and it well made, this is a great buy! bought as an extension cord for my son\\'s bedroom tv and echo dot. works great, love the low profile plug - makes it easy to get his dresser close to the wall this way. only minor detail is the cord. design seems fine, but had trouble keeping it unwound behind his dresser. it wanted to keep rolling back up. after a little stretching, seems to be fine and only a minor annoyance. overall solid product. these look nice and are so easy to use and provide ample outlets; love that the plugs hug the wall as well. i use it in my classroom. very clean and easy to use. i like the way it plugs into the wall very smart design. i use this as an extension cord for my phone charger. it works great and is the perfect length. great extension cord! i love the cord, makes it feel very durable! i used command strips to hang the end of this on the wall above my desk & its been a great extra outlet without being too much. only installed this weeks but seems to work well. needed it to baby proof a room and this has a flatter plug that i can push furniture against. great little cord. very glad it is flat

wall. with the small size and the cheap price, it includes surge protection. a really great product! this works well, as expected. the cord is thick and stiff, but will unwind. it\\'s not a super long extension cord but works well for christmas trees and normal length extensions the fell of this extension cord feels higher end. i love that it blends into our white baseboards. we have high baseboards and its also sturdy enough to sit right at the top of the board so you don\\'t even see the cord at all. highly recommend if you\\'re going for a certain aesthetic. great low-profile / flat

packaged. these things come in handy so i like to keep them on hand this is a really good size, not too large, so it\\'s very useful in different locations. i\\'m very pleased. really nice for smaller things, but pretty sure this broke my macbook power adapter and messed up my battery. i usually have my macbook plugged into this along with the printer for work hours, maybe it works fine for shorter duration but not for 30-40hrs a week. i ended up having to buy a new adapter and reset my battery a few times for my macbook to start back up again. braided rope cord is really nice. i\\'ve probably

and works just like i imagined it would. we needed a three prong extension cord, and for the price this was a no brainer. great surge protector. i was having issues with the plug just falling out of the wall on previous ones. wish the outlet plugs were a little farther apart as i can only use two of these instead of all three. i bought this cord end of february, now it\\'s end of may and it\\'s dead. however the cord did look nice and felt to be of good quality. i love this ge designer 3 prog cord with surge protection. after i lost my ice maker to a surge i started buying these for every plug. i love the muted white color it sort of an upgrade from the old style surge protectors. yes i would buy again and would recommend. i feel very luxurious when looking at this thing. sleek look

based on its claimed size. quality wise i dont know as i just got it. wont return it because its not worth spending 5$ and an hour of my time to get just 10$ back. kind of a rip off for me. this is a

when i got this. works great it feels very well made, nice looking as well with the braided cord. i just wich the plug went straight down instead of at 45 to the right(south east if it was a compass),

extension cord but have a couch or night table right in front of an outlet, get this one. before, i couldn\\'t plug my lamp into the outlet behind the couch because if i did i couldn\\'t push the couch all the way back (and it\\'s a sectional, so i needed to push it so it lined up). with this lay flat extension cord i am able to plug it in and push the couch back all the way. i am not sure if that makes sense, but these type of extension cord are perfect for that! perfect size and length to reach behind my tv and plug in my firestick and chromecast. it is very good quality product,

excellent. looks very nice for a cord does the job, thumbs up. works as expected - its and extension cord with surge protection. absolutely phenomenal product. love the braided cable and low profile plug. does exactly as intended but i purchased this product specifically because it said it was wall mountable which meant i assumed there would be a screw hole or clear way to mount. not the case at all. the only way to mount it was to purchased velcro and attach it to the wall that way. i would have chosen another product had this item been described accurately. this works great! the cord is long and thick. great buy! sturdy and does the job. great cord....definitely recommend this cord clutch design and does the job! nice cord length decent and affordable good product generally a good

does not have mounting holes excellent product. works perfectly. it would be a 5/5 if it had more than 3 outlets and was able to click the surge. i like the flexibility of the product great extension and durability worth it perfect! nice and sturdy! works perfectly worked until it blew out my power in my apartment. plugged it in then it sparked up. nice plug, nice cord, nice outlets, does not have mounting holes excellent product. works perfectly. it would be a 5/5 if it had more than 3 outlets and was able to click the surge. beautiful high quality looking cord, but the warning label about carcinogens led us to return it. my partner was worried about our cat consuming carcinogens. as promised! this product likes to try and catch fire. i have to unplug it after i unplug my charger to keep it from going up. i do not currently have the money to buy a new extension cord. unfortunately, this cord is such a light grey, that it appears to be white. the correct is nice and flexible. don\\'t buy this cord. it has a toxic chemical\\'s warning on the box--not shown on the site\\'s description. there are many safer alternatives, i.e., rohs (reduction of hazardous substances) compliant cords. no reason that manufacturers can\\'t use less (of) toxic substances in these products. look for rohs on these--and other--products. we bought this cord over 2 years ago, it lasts. it was initially used for video presentations, projector, 2 pc\\'s plugged in. even though it\\'s white, it doesn\\'t attract too much dust and dirt. even with 3 items plugged in, it never gets too warm. cord quality seems good but you cant fit 3 plugs into it at once. i wanted to plug a usb charger, macbook plug, and. monitor plug in, and only two will fit. the spacing is too tight, which is very stupid. it seems like this is meant to have a 3-2-3 plugs in it.  returning one of the best extension cords ive purchased! its durable and made to last. this has been a great addition and as it is stylish and i have not had any heat problems. there are times i plug an electric fan and a hair dryer at sae time and no shut off issue so far. i also bought this due to its flat layout when plugging on to the wall, and of course it is braided. great quality, i love them so much i bought two of them. love the feature that the outlet is not sticking out horizontal, so it is perfect for outlets that are behind furniture this does what it needs to do. flat plug design is a plus. i did not care about the fancy braided cord style as this is just an extension cord that i am trying to hide not display. a reliable product from a reliable company/brand. right size, right length. i plan to buy more. it is what it says it is. i like that the cord is so long and that it looks better than just a regular extension cord. this power strip seems to be well made and sturdy. it\\'s nice that is has a power filter and surge protection that will shut down power to any connected devices when the protection expires. one of the best things is that it doesn\\'t have any indicator lights on it. i am using this in a bedroom, so the lack of any annoying light that would disturb nighttime sleep is a real plus. received this product without having ordered it. i fear it is a brushing scam and my info has been compromised. brushing scams are well individuals order their own products and ship to random addresses so that they can leave a 5-atar review. probably a good product though, since it\\'s ge? reasons not a 5. cord feels more like cloth. it\\'s super long does not have a on/off button. but other then that it great. blends in well and the usb ports are a bonus! it fulfills it\\'s purpose. the overall quality of this product has been great so far and i would recommend it! ok good quality extension cord... i used mine in the office at wor to charge my phone with out taking up any computer usb ports. i really like how flexible the cord is and the low profile plug. love it have ordered 2 of these now and they work great. love the cord and colors great item, great price. **does not work with most outlet safety covers or generic wire raceways due to the thickness.** exactly as described this cord is great! the quality is fantastic and what i like most is that it doesn\\'t look like the typical, industrial cords you get at big box stores. great value! great quality and arrived in perfect condition; exactly as expected. the cord is super durable - currently have this running across a door way so i do step on it from time to time and its soft under my feet and its lasting pretty well. (its on the floor since my walls are concrete and i didnt feel like dealing with trying to wrap it against the wall). the flush plug is nice too. as others have mentioned, this extension cord isn\\'t actually made by ge, but maybe that\\'s a good thing. it\\'s very well made, and the fit and finish is superb. and like all good extension cords, it does exactly what it\\'s supposed to. for an around-the-house extension cord, i can\\'t really imagine a way to improve on this. i bought this so i could place my deep fryer on the table to use more safely than a counter top.  its way more sturdy than even i expected. i like the small plug for the wall also. it is exactly what i wanted, which was an extension cord of this length, in a white color so it doesn\\'t stand out too much and with a flat plug to help keep the cord close to the wall - this cord fit all of these requirements well. great quality with flat plug and braided cord. glad i got this instead of the cheap generic one at the drugstore. works with my brother printer. the cord is connected to the plug on the right side which is not an issue for me. this is beautiful and very long which is why i got it, but why not 4-5 plugs? i didn\\'t think i would find it frustrating, but it is a little annoying. very efficient design. because of the plugs shape you can fit it behind a bed or dresser. this made one outlet that used to be completely useless into a three outlet extension cord that\\'s easily accessible. made my life 20x easier for charging my phone, laptop, and table lamp. this came much nicer than we thought it would be; very beefy cord and plug end. very good construction; can\\'t imagine how i could come up with a complaint. it does its job not really much to say besides that. it feels great in the hands. it\\'s pricey but it\\'s brand name so i trust it. very strong material, the cord is thick and covered with nice material. great purchase. sturdy and nice. just what i needed. design, cord length and all. very happy. love that this has a flexible cord. using it in awkward places is easy!! very handy and the cord is nice so.it.wouldnt bend much or wreck the cable needed this in a pinch, gets the job done! its very thick, but not bad! the cord length is the perfect size and its so useful. definitely worth the money and one of the best extension cords ive used! a hassle free extension cord good quality, works well. great value for money and easy to install perfect to plug in near bed more plug in just what i needed for my dorm room great product i used this behind my tv as expected the cord is super long and perfect for connecting my monitor and light. i wish it was more flexible though because it was really hard to maneuver it behind my table nice good god great product!! high quality cable and looks durable.'"
